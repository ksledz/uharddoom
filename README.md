# uharddoom
this is my implementation of a driver for uharddoom device ([https://github.com/mwkmwkmwk/uharddoom/]). it is based on the adlerdev driver ([https://github.com/mwkmwkmwk/adlerdrv]) from the class. 
it uses structures <uharddoom_device>, <uharddoom_context> and, <uharddoom_job> and <uharddoom_buffer> for elementary concepts introduced in the uharddoom description. memory mapping is handled by a list of <struct uharddoom_map>s ordered by virtual addresses in a context. the mapping algorithm of <ioctl_map> just iterates those mappings and checks if it can fit a new mapping between two or after all of them. mapping and unmapping is protected with a mutex, waitqueue with a spinlock. implementation of jobs and waitqueue (<ioctl_wait>, <ioctl_run>)is based on adlerdev's buffers and waitqueue.
